# dotCMS Dutch Translation

Because ISAAC is based in the Netherlands most of our clients are Dutch companies. To be able to server them better we have taken it upon ourselves to translate the [dotCMS](https://www.dotcms.com) admin into Dutch. Although we donate the translation of each new version of dotCMS back to the community, the official dotCMS distributions often contain an older version of the Dutch language file. If you want to make sure that you use the correct version of the Dutch translation, you'll need to download and install the translation file separately. This page provides all Dutch translations of all the dotCMS versions until 2.2.

## Usage

This is not a plugin, so you do not need to install and deploy it like the other dotCMS software that we offer on this site. You do however need to put the correct translation file in a specific dotCMS folder. Follow these steps to do so:

* Determine your version of dotCMS. 
You can do so by logging into the dotCMS backend and clicking the "about dotCMS" link on the bottom of the screen. 
* Download the file on this page. 
* Pick the "Language_nl.properties" file from the folder that has your dotCMS version as its name. 
* Place that "Language_nl.properties" file into the admin's translations folder: "/dotCMS/WEB-INF/messages/". Overwrite the existing file if present.
* Restart dotCMS.

If you want to use the Dutch translations go to the admin's login screen and choose the Dutch flag.

If you spot any mistakes in the translation or if you see missing translations let us know. Leave a comment using the form below or send an e-mail to [koen.peters@isaac.nl](mailto:koen.peters@isaac.nl)
